        <p style="text-align:center">Hi, my name is Tangi Wilson. I was born in Chandler, Arizona.
        <br>I chose to attend the illustrious North Carolina Agricultural and
        <br> Technical State University because of the mass production of
        <br> black engineers every semester. I am a Junior studying Computer 
        <br>Science with a concentration in cybersecurity. With this degree I 
        <br>plan to work as a back-end software developer not only to strengthen 
        <br>my skills in different languages but to also contribute to change 
        <br>and have my work honor me posthumously.

            As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in
            my arms and set out walking once more. <u>I felt deeply
            moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was 
            carrying a very fragile treasure.</u><span style="background:orange">It seemed to me, even,
            that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.</span>In the
            moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed 
            eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I
            said to myself:<b style="color:red">"What I see here is nothing but a 
            shell. What is most important is invisible...‚Äù</b> 
            As his lips opened slightly with the suspicion of a
            half-smile, I said to myself, again:<b style="color:red">"What moves me
            so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping
            here, is his loyalty to a flower-- the image of a rose
            that shines through his whole being like the flame
            of a lamp, even when he is asleep..."</b> And I felt
            him to be more fragile still.<u> I felt the need of
            protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that
            might be extinguished by a little puff of wind...</u>
